# Git prayer

*Git* of ours in the repos you are
Compressed be your *commits*
Come to us your *log*
Locally and *remotely*
Give us today our daily *pull*
Forgive our *conflicts*
As we also forgive those of other geeks
Don't let us fall into *detached HEAD*
and free us from *SVN*
`git commit --amend`
